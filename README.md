MATLAB (R2015a)

See example.m for how to use the statistical test toolbox.

The code to reproduce the results shown in Figures 4 and 5 in 'Inferring flat modularizations in dendrites of pyramidal neurons' 
and 'Inferring nested modularizations in neural networks' is available in the directories 'Fig4_pc' and 'Fig5_nn'.

The code to reproduce the results shown in Figure 3 in 'Inferring functional modules in gene regulatory networks' 
is expected to be available in September 2023.
