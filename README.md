MATLAB (R2015a)

Example code that reproduces the results shown in Fig. 4 for "Inferring flat modularizations in dendrites of pyramidal neurons" 
is available in the directory 'Fig4_pc'.

The code to reproduce the results shown in Fig. 3 (gene regulatory networks) and Fig. 5 (neural networks) 
is expected to be available in September 2023.
